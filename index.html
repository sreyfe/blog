<p>For about a week there, I was into cricket. Why exactly, I cannot say. Maybe it had to do with the T20 World Cup?
Though I didn&#39;t know it was happening until I had already decided to watch cricket, it must have had something to do with it.
The coincidence is too striking. Maybe I saw an ad somewhere? Or there was something in the air? Maybe it was just
good luck. Having decided I would now watch cricket, I texted my friend Sidd to tell him of this change to my lifestyle
and he told me that the very next day he would be heading to New York to see the India vs. USA match. I watched, hoping
to see him in the crowd. The US fought nobly, but were defeated.</p>
<p>It seems there&#39;s been a lot of interest in US cricket recently. This must be both cause and effect of the national teams recent (relative)
success. When I asked Sidd what was behind this, he told me &quot;because there are a lot of Indians in Texas.&quot; I can neither 
confirm nor deny. But I recently learned that cricket was once a much more popular sport in the US. The Wikipedia
article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cricket_in_the_United_States">History of cricket in the United States</a> asserts that there was a time when the game was significantly
more popular than baseball, and that &quot;Abraham Lincoln, later to be President, had watched two American cities play each
other in an 1849 cricket match.&quot;</p>
<p>But it is a weird and uncanny thing to see Americans play cricket. International cricket seems so bound-up
with the British Empire, especially the British Empire of the 19th century. What relation does Oman have with the West Indies, or Afghanistan
with Australia, besides British colonial power? And there is something vaguely maritime about the sport. The wicket, shaped
like the hull of a colossal ship, the bat like an oar... After Sloterdijk could we not say that cricket, with its emphasis on debts
accrued and repaid, on the attainment of exteriority, is the perfect game for the era of colonial globalization? And here, once 
more, are the Americans -- returned to our native context?</p>
<p>But I know nothing of this. Who knows, is C. L. R. James, whose <em>Beyond a Boundary</em> I have wanted to read for a long time. This 
brush with cricket has finally given me the excuse. Borrowing a phrase from Kipling, James&#39;s Leitsatz for the book is &quot;What do 
they know of cricket who only cricket know?&quot; In my case, it&#39;s really &quot;What do they know of cricket who know nothing of cricket?&quot;
But anyway, the idea ist that cricket is a deeply ingrained practice in English society,
and in the society of the West Indies, among other places -- that to understand cricket is to understand something fundamental
in these societies, and that, vice versa, in order to understand cricket, you need to understand a lot about societies. In other
words, the book explores cricket in all its contingencies with the world. James loved cricket, and though he is a professional
critic, he seems really to believe in the sport as a force for good, and this gives the book a sort of warm glow. If, like me,
you know nothing of cricket, a non-insignificant percentage of the books language will be incomprehensible to you (&quot;silly mid-off&quot;,
&quot;on the back foot through the covers,&quot; &quot;slow bowler,&quot; etc.), but there is something to enjoy here too. It&#39;s a little like the 
<em>Voynich manuscript</em> or the <em>Codex Seraphianus,</em> or like a child looking at a printed page before they can read...</p>
<p>Of particular interest to me was James&#39;s claim that, although cricket reached its height in Victorian England, it was not a 
Victorian game in either &quot;origin or essence.&quot; Instead, it came from an England that was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>still unconquered by the Industrial Revolution. It travelled by saddle and carriage. Whenever it could
it ate and drank prodigiously. It was not finicky in morals. It enjoyed life. It prized the virtues of frankness, independence,
individuality, conviviality. There were rulers and ruled, the educated and the uneducated. If the two groupings could be
described as two nations they were neither of them conscious of the division as a state of things which ought not to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve heard of this England... I think I read somewhere that in pre-Victorian Europe, England was once considered an
emotional, choleric nation, like Italy today. James asserts that Dickens is really a pre-Victorian, and this is what allowed
him to be such a good critic of Victorian England. But he believes that the great representative/representer of this era is Hazlitt.
He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hazlitt was an intellectual to his fingertips, and a
militant, an extreme democrat who suffered martyrdom for his opinions.
Yet he is not a divided man, he has no acute consciousness either
of class or of divided culture. He discusses with equal verve the virtues
of a classical education and the ignorance of the learned. It is impossible
to distinguish any change in his style whether he writes on
William Cobbett, on his First Acquaintance with Poets, on John Cavanagh,
the Fives Player, or on the Fight between Bill Neate and the
Gas-man. It would be comparatively simple to maintain that his essay
on The Fight is his finest piece. It is what he called &#39;a complete thing&#39;,
giving such a picture of the England of his time as can nowhere else
be found in such a narrow compass. Wide as is his range, unlike the
late Robert Lynd or A. G. Gardiner (to mention two at random), he
does not fit his subject into a practised pattern. He takes his whole
self wherever he goes; he is ready to go everywhere; every new experience
renews and expands him. He writes as freely and as publicly of a
most degrading love-affair as of Elizabethan literature. The possibility
of such completeness of expression ended with him and has not yet
returned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had never heard of Hazlitt before James, like I had never heard of Browne before Borges. It&#39;s always nice to get a recommendation
from a good writer, and it didn&#39;t take long before I&#39;d found <em>The Fight</em> and read it. It really is very good, and I have reproduced
it at the end of this post, for your reading pleasure, from the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/72206">12th volume of Project Gutenberg&#39;s Collected Works of William Hazlitt</a>.
What is good about it is what I think is good about good essays in general: contingency. In <em>The Fight</em>, Hazlitt is driven about 
by circumstance, and it is also circumstance or, as he might call it, FANCY, that informs his style. The essay makes no
claim to essential knowledge. Instead, it moves lightly from from idea to idea, always acknowledging the particular position of the
writer/narrator as he moves from London to the country by mail-coach and back again. This is what&#39;s good about <em>Beyond a Boundary</em>
too. &quot;Neither cricket reminiscences nor autobiography,&quot; it revels in its contingency.</p>
