			<h1>Viewing Columbo at a Distance</h1>
			<p>
			Inspired by Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton’s <i>Distant Viewing:
				Computational Exploration of Digital Images </i>, <a 
				    href="https://weltliteratur.net/curb-your-enthusiasm-season-9-network-analysis/">
				Frank Fischer's
				network analysis of Curb</a>, and
			the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/columboscreens.bsky.social">Columbo
				Screenshots BlueSky bot</a>,
			I decided to take a look at the
			colors of Columbo. 
			</p>

			<p>Firstly,
			I wanted to be able to find
			the Columbo frame with the average color closest to a
			given color.
			In order to do this, I first
			got my hands
			on a low-resolution (360p) rip
			of the entirety of Columbo. Then, using the cv2 Python wrapper for
			OpenCV, I iterated through every frame and recorded each frame’s
			average red, green, and blue value (deleting the black bars at the 
			top and bottom of the frames when necessary)
			, along with the episode number,
			season number, and frame count. The resulting Pandas DataFrame was
			10,782,016 rows long, each row representing a frame, and the
			resulting CSV weighed in at 1gb. Reasonably hefty.</p>

			<p>This
			process took about eight hours (I challenge
			my dear friend/mortal enemy Siddha Mavuram to do it faster).
			But once it was done, I was
			pretty close to being able to color match Columbo frames. All I had
			to do next was find a loss function. I settled on summed squared
			error, i.e. finding the difference between the frames’ RGB values
			and the desired RGB values, squaring them, and summing them. Then all
			you need to do is find the frame with the lowest loss.</p>

			<p>For
			example, suppose I want to find the frame with the color #3a5133 (a
			dark green). All I need to do
			is calculate this loss for the ~11,000,000 frames (with Pandas NumPy
			this actually takes no time at all), then sort the frames by
			ascending loss and take the first. In this case, the frame with the
			lowest loss is this one:</p><br>

			<p>Using
			this color matching, you can produce color palettes of frames, like

			<p>Four
			of the seven colors from the <em>Rainbow</em> pallete come 
			from the same episode. S02E07 <i>The
				Most Dangerous Match</i> begins with
			a dream sequence with a shifting, rainbow strobe effect, meaning that
			if you’re looking for highly saturated, monocolor Columbo frames,
			its your best bet nine times out of ten.</p>

			<p>To
			see just how crazy this strobe effect is in terms of color value
			saturation, take a look at the first five minutes of this episode
			compared to the first five minutes of the episodes that come directly
			before and after.</p>

			<p>Cool
			as these frames are, they are outliers, and I got to wondering what
			the general color distribution of Columbo looks like. To take a look
			at it, I took a sample of 1,000 frames and visualized each of them as
			a point of that color in 3D space, with their RGB values as xyz 
			coordinates. This is that general distribution:</p>


			<img src="/assets/img/columbo/general_sample.gif" alt="general sample">


			<p>As
			you can see, the xyz coordinates tend to increase and decrease together,
			clustering around the center diagonal of the cube, and producing
			colors that are, on average, pretty gray, although we get some
			colorful scallion-style divergence at the top. The average color
			(visualized below) is a dark gray.</p>

			<img src="/assets/img/columbo/average.gif" alt="average">

			<p>But
			the outliers really are the most fun, and I wanted to see them in
			this format too. To this end, I added a boolean column (“outlier”)
			to the combined data frame, which was true when a given frame had a
			zscore of three or higher, and false otherwise. Sampling from the
			outliers produces this visualization:</p>

			<img src="/assets/img/columbo/outlier.gif" alt="outlier">

			<p>And
			sampling 500 from each (outlier and non-outlier) gives a broad (if
			quantitatively inaccurate) account of the colors of Columbo:</p>

			<img src="/assets/img/columbo/stratified.gif" alt="stratified">

			<p>In
			general, it seems the average color palette of Columbo is muted and
			rather dark. The figure below illustrates the average RGB values per 
			episode throughout the series.
			</p>

			<img src="/assets/img/columbo/rgb_per_ep_fixed.png" alt="rbg per ep">
			<p>
			The colors seem to be generally the same over the course
			of the series, although season 8 is significantly darker than the rest.
			In 1989, after a 12 year hiatus, ABC releases new episodes (the first 7 
			seasons ran on NBC).
			Here, the format of the
			show switches from 4:3 to 16:9 (at least in my rip).
			The first episode of season 8 (Columbo Goes to the Guillotine) is just
			about as dark as the show gets, and we don't return to normal until 
			season 9.
			 It seems the ABC execs wanted a change of tone
			(let's call it "Columbo goes dark"), but reverted to the old
			brightness in the following seasons.

			<p>I
			was also curious to see how colors change over the course of the
			episode. Across episodes, I took the average color of each frame, and
			came up with the below graph. The divot at around ten minutes is
			interesting, but I don’t know how to explain it. My only guess is
			that around 10 minutes, the murders usually take place… An avenue
			for future research.</p>

			<p>Perhaps
